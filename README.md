**Context**: One of the main key to scientific development is data availability. Not only the data is easily discovered and downloaded, there's also needs for the data to be easily reused. Geothermal researchers, research institutions also industries are the three main stakeholders to foster data sharing and data reuse. Very expensive deep well datasets as well as advance logging datasets are very important not only for exploitation purposes but also for the community involved eg: for regional planning or common environmental analyses.

**FAIR**: In data sharing, we have four principles of F.A.I.R data. Principle 1 Findable: data uploaded to open repository with proper data documentations and data schema, Principle 2 Accessible: removed access restrictions such as userid and password for easy downloads. In case of data from commercial entities, embargoed data is permitted with a clear embargo duration and data request procedure, Principle 3 Interoperable: all data must be prepared in a manner for straightforward data exchange between platforms, Principle 4 Reusable: all data must be submitted using common conventional file format, preferably text-based file (eg `csv` or `txt`) therefore it can be analyzed using various software and hardware. 

**Promoting industries to share data**: The fact that geothermal industries are packed with for-profit motivations and capital intensive would give even more reasons to embrace data sharing. It would be a good way for them to share their role in supporting society. 

**Closing**: The contributions from multiple stakehoders are the most essential part in science development. In the context of commercial industry, data sharing is a form corporate social responsibility (CSR). It shouldn't be defined only as giving out funding to support local communities.
